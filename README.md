# Library Management System

## Introduction
The **Library Management System** is a full-stack web application designed to manage books, track borrowings, and maintain an organized record of book transactions. It allows users to register, log in, search for books, borrow, and return them while providing administrators with tools to manage the library database.

## Features
- **User Authentication** (JWT-based login & registration)

- **User Profiles** (View borrowed books history)
- **Search & Filter Books**
- **Role-based Access** (Admins can manage books & users)

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
- Users must be authenticated to borrow or return books.
- Only admins can add or remove books from the system.
- Each book can be borrowed by only one user at a time.
